[Common Questions]
Q: What documents do I need for a home loan?
A: You generally need a valid government ID, proof of income (ITR or Payslips), and a Certificate of Employment.

Q: Do you offer properties near the University of Santo Tomas (UST)?
A: Yes, we highly recommend "The Scholar's Den" along España Blvd, which is specifically designed for students.
